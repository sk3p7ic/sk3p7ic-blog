As my resume shows, I've been in college for a while. I'd like to touch on the
journey that I've taken and consider the future that I'm working towards.

## The Journey Thus Far

### Initial University Years

I'd technically started my college journey in high school, taking a few courses
that enabled me to graduate with some of my general education requirements out
of the way. This time, however, is also where I'd formed a poor habit of not
taking my education seriously, often procrastinating on assignments or not
doing the best work that I could. I still graduated as a member of the National
Honor Society and top ten percent of my class, but I could (and should) have
done better.

My initial years of college also were not the best--I'd failed a few courses
and had to retake them. Additionally, I'd changed my major at one point, fed up
with the business courses that my Computer Information Systems degree required,
wanting instead to focus more on programming. There were cyclical periods of
time in which I'd do well, and then poorly again, still struggling with my
ill-formed habits from high school and finding myself unable to communicate my
struggles to my professors, who I'd often avoid so as to not have to admit that
I was struggling. I'd also not take advantage of the resources that were made
available to me, such as tutoring, and would instead try to figure things out
on my own or accept that I'd fail. This in turn would worsen my anxiety,
depression, and self-esteem issues. As such, in the Spring of 2021 I snapped
and opted instead to take a break from college, thinking that I could work as
an apprentice electrician in the meantime.

Towards the end of that spring, I applied for my local IBEW's apprenticeship
program through the local JATC. I was accepted and was to start working over
the summer. As a result, I'd wanted to drop my courses, but was unaware that
"dropping out" of college would enable me to drop my courses without the hit
to Texas's six-drop rule. I'd instead opted to fail my courses, thinking that
I'd be able to retake them later. Looking back, I wish that I'd opted instead
to speak with my advisor about my options, but at the time I was feeling too
anxious to do so.

After a long summer working with the looming threat of working 6-7 days a week,
I'd decided to return to college, finding myself with some renewed motivation
to do well. Things, however, did not go as planned, with me getting COVID at
the start of the semester, leaving me to miss important classes. Oncemore, I
started slipping and was afraid to reach out. As such, I failed.

This time, however, was different. That fall semester I was already on
academic probation as a result of my spring performance, and the failure I'd
received that semester put me on academic suspension. I'd felt low. I'd tried
to better myself, and yet I still failed. I'd felt like that could be the end
of my college journey, and potentially my career as a software developer.

### Community College

Unable to return to TAMU-SA for a semester, I worked on myself and my mental
health. I'd started speaking with a doctor about my issues, getting myself the
help I needed. Additionally, I knew that I wanted to return to TAMU-SA to
finish my degree, but I also knew that I needed to prove myself. As such, I
opted to enroll in a local community college, San Antonio College, to retake
Calculus II over the summer. I also submitted an appeal to TAMU-SA to be
reinstated, which was later accepted.

The course I took at SAC spanned the length of just over a month, requiring me
to report daily for a 3-hour lecture and then spend the rest of the day
studying and working on assignments. This was a challenge and I'd drawn near
to cracking once more when one aspect of the course that I'd done well in the
first time around, partial fractions, was not clicking for me. My mom had
convinced me to try a tutor and after a single session I'd understood where I
was getting stuck and thus was able to complete the course with an **A**.
Finally, I'd proven to myself that I could do well--that I could succeed.
Moreover, I'd also found a new appreciation for mathematics, which I'd
previously despised.

Better yet, I was also accepted back into TAMU-SA, and was thus able to return
to my degree program starting during their summer II semester.

### My Return to TAMU-SA

I'd returned to TAMU-SA with a renewed sense of purpose. I'd wanted to do well
and prove to myself that I could succeed. I was thankfully able to take a Web
Development course that summer, performing well and getting yet another **A**.

The next semesters also went well, with me applying myself, keeping on top of
assignments and completing them as early as possible, reaching out if I needed
help. I'd also upped my note-taking game, opting to take notes in \\(\LaTeX\\)
using NeoVim and storing my notes and assignments in a private GitHub
repository. My assignments were also being completed using LaTeX, which I'd
found to be a great way to keep my work organized and legible--something that
I believe my professors appreciated.

I'd also started to get involved with the university, joining the ACM chapter
and taking part in their events and workshops. Then with the summer 2023 term
I took a course in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence during which
our final project involved creating a neural network to determine whether or
not a given string of text could be used for a SQL injection attack. This
project ended up being part of my professor's research, with him reaching out
to me to ask if I'd be willing to contribute my solution to a paper he was
working on. I'd agreed, and thus my name was added to the paper as the second
author. Better yet, he also asked me to aid him in future research, which I
will hopefully be doing this spring now that the NSF grant he'd applied for
has been approved.

This past fall semester I spent acting as my ACM chapter's Logistics Officer,
assisting them with the vacant position after the previous holder left. As an
officer, I:

- Helped plan and execute my university's first 24-hour hackathon, for which
  there were attendees from several universities across Texas.
  - Acted as a member of the Web Team for the hackathon, helping them build and
    maintain the hackathon's website. I mainly assisted with helping others
    understand and get up and running on the codebase (which was forked from
    [gh:acmutd/hackportal](https://github.com/acmutd/hackportal) and is a
    template Next.js application featuring Firebase / Firestore intergration
    for storing user and event data) in addition to creating an endpoint and
    admin page to facilitate the easier view of user check-in data to various
    panels and events.
  - Hosted a panel on Basic Web Development, covering the basics of HTML and
    CSS in the development of a simple portfolio page for a developer. This
    panel also served as a primer for the panel that immediately followed mine
    in which one of your professors covered APIs and how to use / consume them,
    both in terms of web APIs and code libraries. Attendance for my panel was
    roughly 15-20 people.
  - Triaged and fixed an issue with the website during the event in which, due
    to the poor implementation of calls to our Firebase from the forked code
    that we did not have time to fix, I indentified that we had exceeded the
    free plan and was able to resolve the issue through adding a payment
    source. I notated the incident and recommended that for the next time we
    host a hackathon that the website be one which is developed by us and uses
    caching and other techniques to ensure the minimal number of calls to the
    backend are made.
- Hosted the same Web Development panel for my ACM charter, covering nearly the
  content and this time boasting an attendance of nearly 30 students. A survey
  was performed after the workshop for which I was rated 4.7.
- Assisted with planning and coordinating travel to external events, such as
  HackUTD at UT Dallas, by assiting with the procurement of lodging and other
  necessities.

While I did greatly enjoy my time acting as an officer, I ultimately did not
run for election in any other position during our December elections mainly
because being elected would mean that once I graduate in the spring I would
create a vacancy. Instead, I opted to let new officers be elected so that they
may continue to grow as individuals and make the program even better than it is
currently.

## The Present and Future

I am now nearing my final semester of my undergraduate studies with only a
three courses left to take. I am also working as a student worker for my
university's IT department as a web developer, which I am enjoying for the
most part. There is, of course, the feeling of imposter syndrome that I am
stuggling with, but I am trying to work though it.

While I could state that this upcoming May will be the end of my college
journey, I'd prefer it not be. Rather, I have been considering applying for
graduate school with the intent of working towards a deeper understanding of
computing and the opportunity to work on research. I fear that my past may
inhibit my ability to be accepted into a graduate program, but I am hopeful
that my recent performance will be enough to show that I am capable of doing
well, with my last 60 hours of coursework having been completed with a 3.46.

As such, I intend to spend this upcoming semester working on researching and
implementing a new programming language during the completion of my Senior
Project course that I will be taking. The thought of this is exciting, and
I've found myself over this winter break unable to stop thinking about it,
having already started learning more about the implementation of lexers and
parsers. I am hopeful that this will be a good project to work on, and that
it will be something that I can be proud of. Additionally, I am also hopeful
that I will be able to work on research with my professor, and that I will
be able to contribute to the field of computing in some way. Nevertheless, I
also look forward to the personal growth that should occur as a result of the
work that I intend to do.

I would like to get in to more "serious" research some day, though at this time
I am unsure of which specific area of computing I'd find best-suited for me to
work on. While standard development is fun and I would likely find myself
sufficiently satisfied with a normal development position, I do admire the
ability to create and innovate with research, contributing overall to the field
rather than constantly working toward the maintenance of legacy codebases, such
as with what is a major aspect of my current job.

Past that, I am unsure of what the future holds for me. I do not know if I
will attempt to stick with academia or if I will instead opt to work in
industry--something that I have not yet experienced aside from my current
student worker position of which I often find too "slow" for my liking.
Regardless, I am hopeful that I will be able to find a job that I enjoy and
that I will be able to continue to grow as a developer and as a person.
